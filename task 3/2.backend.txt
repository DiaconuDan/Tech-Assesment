a,b. Short description of API - URI, format and possible frameworks

GET	api/profiles -> get all profiles
GET	api/profiles/:id -> get profile by id

We will call these endpoints to fetch the data as previously mentioned in the frontend.txt.

We would need a db.config to configure the parameters for our DB: Mysql/other options fine too
We can use an ORM to help us work with db - Sequalize/other options fine too
We create express sever -> CORS and express rest api 
Create data model
Profile controller
Routes for the get operations ( maybe crud in future ? )

Profile:
 - id
 - name
 - fullname
 - photo
 - details

Write tests to see data is returned correctly.

Nest.js is also a very good framework implemented on top of express, but might be overkill for what we need in here.
